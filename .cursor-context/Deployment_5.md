# Deployment Phase 5: Beta Tester Go-Live (Still Test Keys)

**Goal:** Provide access to your beta testers and gather initial feedback.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 4 completed. Your Production Vercel deployment is password-protected and fully functional using **Test** Stripe keys and webhooks.

**Steps:**

1.  **Prepare Communication:**
    *   Draft an email or message for your beta testers.
    *   Include the following information:
        *   The **Production Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
        *   The **Vercel Deployment Protection username and password** set in Phase 4.
        *   Clear instructions that this is a **beta version** and they should expect bugs.
        *   Instructions on how to perform the payment step using **Stripe test card numbers** (e.g., provide the `4242...` number and link to [Stripe's testing docs](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#use-test-cards)) and explain this grants them free access for testing.
        *   Guidance on what specific features or flows you want them to test.
        *   Clear instructions on how to report bugs or provide feedback (e.g., email, feedback form, Discord channel).

2.  **Send Invitations:**
    *   Send the communication to your selected beta testers.

3.  **Monitor & Support:**
    *   Be available to answer tester questions.
    *   Monitor Vercel logs (Build, Runtime/Functions) for any errors they might encounter.
    *   Monitor Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode) -> Payments and Webhooks for activity.
    *   Monitor Supabase dashboard (Auth, Database) for user activity and potential data issues.

4.  **Collect Feedback:**
    *   Actively gather and organize the feedback and bug reports provided by your testers.

**Success Check:**

*   [ ] Communication sent to beta testers with all necessary information (URL, password, test card info, feedback channel).
*   [ ] Beta testers confirm they can access the application using the password.
*   [ ] Beta testers confirm they can sign up/log in.
*   [ ] Beta testers confirm they can complete the payment flow using test card details.
*   [ ] You are receiving feedback and/or bug reports through your chosen channel.
*   [ ] Monitoring shows tester activity in Vercel, Stripe (Test), and Supabase logs.
