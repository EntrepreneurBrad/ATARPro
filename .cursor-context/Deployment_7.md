# Deployment Phase 7: Public Launch

**Goal:** Make your application accessible to the general public.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 6 completed. Your production deployment is running with Live Stripe keys and has been smoke-tested.

**Steps:**

1.  **Final Access Check:**
    *   Ensure Vercel Password Protection is **disabled** for the Production environment (unless you intentionally want a password for launch). (Vercel Project Settings -> Security -> Deployment Protection).

2.  **(Optional) Configure Custom Domain:**
    *   If you haven't already, add your custom domain:
        *   Go to Vercel Project Settings -> Domains.
        *   Enter your domain name and follow the instructions to add it (usually involves adding `CNAME` or `A` records in your domain registrar's DNS settings).
        *   Wait for DNS propagation and for Vercel to issue an SSL certificate.

3.  **Final Polish & Checks:**
    *   Review your landing page, pricing information, and any public-facing text.
    *   Do one last check of the critical user flows (signup, login, core feature, payment) on the final URL (custom domain or Vercel URL).

4.  **Announce Launch:**
    *   Tell the world! Update your website, post on social media, email your waiting list, etc.

5.  **Monitor Closely:**
    *   Keep a very close eye on:
        *   Vercel Logs (Build, Runtime/Functions)
        *   Stripe Dashboard (Live Mode - Payments, Balances, Webhooks, Disputes)
        *   Supabase Dashboard (Auth, Database usage, Logs)
        *   Any analytics tools you have integrated.
        *   Customer support channels.

**Success Check:**

*   [ ] Production deployment is accessible publicly without a password (unless intended).
*   [ ] (If applicable) Custom domain is configured correctly and serving the application over HTTPS.
*   [ ] Public users can successfully access the site, sign up, and use the core features.
*   [ ] Live payments are being processed correctly via Stripe.
*   [ ] Monitoring systems are active and showing normal activity (or quickly highlighting issues).

**Congratulations! Your application is live!**
