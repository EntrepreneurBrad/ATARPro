# Project Summary: Phases 1-8

This document summarizes the progress and state of the ATAR Calculator project after completing the first eight phases, focusing on setting up authentication, user profiles, a functional Stripe payment flow with automated database updates, and frontend state synchronization.

## Overall Goal Achieved So Far:

The application now has a functional user authentication system using Supabase, protected application routes, a linked user profile table (`public.users`) with automatic creation via trigger and Row Level Security, a complete Stripe payment checkout flow, and a secure webhook handler that automatically updates the user's subscription status in the database upon successful payment. **Furthermore, the frontend application now fetches and manages the user's profile state (including subscription status) upon login and handles related loading states.**

## Phase Summaries:

**Phase 1: Basic User Authentication Setup (Supabase)**
*   **Goal:** Integrate Supabase for user authentication.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Supabase project configured with URL and anon key in `.env`.
    *   `@supabase/supabase-js` library installed.
    *   Supabase client initialized in `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`.
    *   `.gitignore` created to exclude `.env`.
    *   `@supabase/auth-ui-react` and `@supabase/auth-ui-shared` installed.
    *   `AuthPage.tsx` component created using Supabase Auth UI.
    *   `/auth` route added in `App.tsx`.
    *   Auth state (`session`, `loadingAuth`) management implemented in `App.tsx`, listening to `onAuthStateChange`.
    *   `Header.tsx` updated to show conditional Login/Logout buttons.
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. Users can sign up, log in, and log out.

**Phase 2: Protecting Application Routes**
*   **Goal:** Ensure only logged-in users can access core application features.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component created.
    *   Logic added to `ProtectedRoute` to check `loadingAuth` and `session` state.
    *   Routing in `App.tsx` updated to wrap protected routes within `ProtectedRoute`.
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. Unauthenticated users are redirected.

**Phase 3: Stripe Setup & Backend Checkout API**
*   **Goal:** Create a backend API endpoint to generate Stripe Checkout sessions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Stripe account configured (Test Mode, Product, Price ID, API Keys).
    *   Stripe keys and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` added to `.env`.
    *   `api/create-checkout-session.ts` Vercel function created (POST request, initializes Stripe, creates session with `userId` as `client_reference_id`, returns `sessionId`).
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested.

**Phase 4: Frontend Stripe Redirect**
*   **Goal:** Implement frontend UI and logic to initiate the Stripe Checkout redirect.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   `@stripe/stripe-js` installed.
    *   `stripePromise` loaded in `App.tsx`.
    *   `PaymentButton.tsx` created (fetches session from `/api/create-checkout-session`, calls `stripe.redirectToCheckout`).
    *   Placeholder `/payment-success` and `/payment-cancel` routes/components added.
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. Redirect flow works.

**Phase 5: Basic Webhook Verification**
*   **Goal:** Create a backend webhook endpoint to securely receive and verify events from Stripe.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Stripe CLI (`stripe listen`) used for local forwarding.
    *   Webhook secret added to `.env`.
    *   `micro` installed.
    *   `api/stripe-webhook.ts` Vercel function created (disables body parsing, reads raw body, verifies signature via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`, logs details, returns 200).
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. Webhook signature verification works.

**Phase 6: Supabase Profile Infrastructure**
*   **Goal:** Ensure a user profile exists in the database for each authenticated user, storing application-specific data securely with appropriate access controls.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Confirmed existence of `public.users` table linked via foreign key to `auth.users.id`.
    *   SQL trigger `create_public_profile_on_signup` on `auth.users` created to automatically insert a row into `public.users` upon signup.
    *   Row Level Security (RLS) policies on `public.users` configured and verified:
        *   Authenticated users can select/update only their own row.
        *   Unauthenticated users cannot select any rows.
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. User profiles (`public.users`) are automatically created and secured via RLS.

**Phase 7: Webhook Database Update**
*   **Goal:** Connect the Stripe webhook confirmation (`checkout.session.completed`) to the Supabase database, updating the user's `public.users` record to mark them as subscribed (`is_subscribed = true`).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Supabase Service Role Key obtained and added to `.env` as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
    *   `api/stripe-webhook.ts` modified:
        *   Imported `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`.
        *   Initialized a Supabase *Admin* client using the Service Role Key (bypassing RLS).
        *   Added logic inside the `checkout.session.completed` event handler:
            *   Retrieves `userId` from `session.client_reference_id`.
            *   Uses the Admin client to `update` the `public.users` table, setting `is_subscribed = true` where `id` matches the `userId`.
            *   Includes logging for success/failure of the database operation.
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested. The webhook now successfully updates the user's subscription status in the database upon payment completion.

**Phase 8: Frontend Profile Fetching**
*   **Goal:** Load the user's profile data (`is_subscribed`) from `public.users` into the frontend application state (`src/App.tsx`) when the user is logged in.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   `UserProfile` interface defined in `src/types/index.ts`.
    *   `userProfile` and `loadingProfile` state variables added to `App.tsx`.
    *   `fetchUserProfile` async function created in `App.tsx` to query Supabase.
    *   Authentication `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx` significantly refactored:
        *   Handles initial session check (`getSession`) and sets up `onAuthStateChange` listener.
        *   Listener triggers `fetchUserProfile` on relevant auth events (`INITIAL_SESSION`, `SIGNED_IN`).
        *   Manages `loadingAuth` and `loadingProfile` states.
        *   Includes `isMounted` checks for safety with async operations.
        *   **Workaround:** A `setTimeout` (50ms) was added around the core logic inside the `useEffect` to mitigate a race condition where `getSession` or DB queries would hang if initializing with an existing session token.
        *   **Refinement:** `useRef` was added to manage the auth subscription object for reliable unsubscribing in the cleanup function due to the `setTimeout`.
    *   `isLoadingApp` condition in `App.tsx` updated to include `loadingProfile`.
    *   `userProfile` and `loadingProfile` props passed down (e.g., to `Layout` component).
*   **Status:** Completed and Tested (with workaround). Frontend correctly reflects `is_subscribed` status. Loading issue on refresh resolved.

## Current State:

*   Users can sign up, log in, access protected parts of the application, and have a corresponding profile automatically created in `public.users`.
*   RLS ensures users can only read/update their own profile data.
*   Logged-in users can initiate a payment flow via Stripe Checkout.
*   The backend webhook (`api/stripe-webhook.ts`) securely verifies successful payments from Stripe (`checkout.session.completed`), extracts the associated `userId`, and **automatically updates the `is_subscribed` field to `true` for that user in the `public.users` table using the Supabase Admin client.**
*   **The frontend application (`App.tsx`) now reliably fetches the user's profile (including `is_subscribed` status) from the database upon login/session restoration, manages loading states, and makes this state available to child components.**
*   The core authentication, payment-to-database update, and database-to-frontend state synchronization flow is now complete.
