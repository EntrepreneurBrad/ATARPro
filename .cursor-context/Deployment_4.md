# Deployment Phase 4: Implement Beta Access Control

**Goal:** Prevent unauthorized users from accessing your beta application using Vercel's built-in password protection.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 3 completed. Your application is deployed and core functionality + test webhooks are working.

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to Vercel Security Settings:**
    *   In your Vercel Dashboard, go to your Project.
    *   Click the "Settings" tab.
    *   Select "Security" from the left-hand menu.

2.  **Enable Password Protection:**
    *   Find the "Deployment Protection" section.
    *   Click "Enable".

3.  **Configure Protection:**
    *   **Environment:** Select "Production". This ensures only your main deployment URL is protected, while preview deployments remain accessible without a password (useful for internal testing).
    *   **Username & Password:** Enter a username and a strong, unique password.
        *   **Important:** Securely store this password; you will share it only with your beta testers.
    *   Click "Save".

**Success Check:**

*   [ ] Navigate to your **Production** Vercel URL (e.g., `your-project-name.vercel.app`, *not* a preview URL) in an incognito/private browser window.
*   [ ] You should be immediately prompted with a basic HTTP authentication dialog asking for a username and password **before** your application loads.
*   [ ] Entering incorrect credentials should deny access.
*   [ ] Entering the correct username and password (that you just set) should grant access and load your application.
